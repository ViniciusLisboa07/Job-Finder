# Job Finder
## Application created for study
This application was developed to study Javascript as a means for back-end production. This was my first experience in full-stack, and it's a final project of an online course that I did.
## Some features
### The first impression
In this project the Bootstrap framework was used to make the stylization of the pages, this framework is one of the most used in the development of the web.

 ### Available jobs in the home page
  As we can see, the available jobs are on the home page to find them easily. The newest post is at the top of the page and has a yellow style.

### Creating new job
In the top right corner, you can see a red button that works to create a new job vacancy. Clicking this button will open a form page for you to fill in your details. After creation, the red button at the bottom works to send the information to the database, and then a new job vacancy will be created that can be viewed.

### The search
Still on the home page, a search bar is located on the banner, the functionality is through comparison so you can search for parts of the word and still find it. As in the following images.
